        The Workspace contains the GMM configuration file, GMM logs, the database, assets
        and temporary files. By default the GMM will only ever change data which is inside
        this folder.
        
        Change the value of this environment entry to change its location. Absolute paths
        work, too. If relative, the path is relative to the current's process working
        directory (user dir).
        
        Example 1: "./gmm-workspace"
        Example 2:
        If you want the workspace folder to be located in your tomcat home directory, change
