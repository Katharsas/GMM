//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Current version of SASS does not include dependency managment (import only once),
// but rather copy-pastes code where you put an include statement.
// This will be changed in SASS 4.0.
//
// Until then try to avoid including stuff from multiple files where the files
// could end up in the same final file (you can do so if necessary).
//
// Files from the include folder are save to use anywhere because they don't
// actually render out any CSS (don't add CSS to them).
